Question :- 
1. PODS
2. Nodes
3. Cluster 
4. Container 

* How to inject dynamic configs or secrets into pods
There two type :- Secret and ConfigMap 
ConfigMap :- is used to provide the no sestive data like API Url Can be passed from to the pod using enviornment varibale
ConfigMap :- 
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: app-config
data:
  DATABASE_URL: "postgres://user@host:5432/db"
  FEATURE_FLAG: "true"

Secret :-
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: app-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  DB_PASSWORD: cGFzc3dvcmQ=     # "password" in base64
* We ussaly not keep the password here either We use like {{ DB_PAPSSWORD }} and on the time of CICD run we fetch it from here or we can use AWS Secret Manager 
 Example Using in the POD file 
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: secret-demo
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: myapp:latest
      env:
        - name: DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: app-secret
              key: DB_PASSWORD
